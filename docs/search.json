However, one per data set is required.)\n\nAre juvenile squirrels friendlier to humans than adult squirrels? How does this manifest in their behavior?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nThe research topic is about friendliness, innocence, and age in squirrels. We predict that younger squirrels will be less friendly around humans because they have not yet learned that these humans are largely harmless and (at times) give food. We predict this because we can observe this behavior in younger humans since younger kids tend to be less informed about their surroundings, and therefore will lean towards being more cautious of things. We would have to look into this data to confirm any of these predictions. The complete opposite of this prediction might be true.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThe variables involved in this research question are Age, Approaches, Indifferent, and Runs from. These are all categorical variables. The latter three variables all describe behavior around humans."

In their study, they sampled a total of 20 squirrels, 10 of which were taken from an urban environment, and 10 of which were taken from a rural environment. The data collected in this study found that urban squirrels were able to tolerate a smaller distance between them and a human presence than rural squirrels. It was also observed that the time it took a squirrel to react to the human presence was more delayed for the urban squirrels than the rural squirrels. This study shows a certain level of adaptability and behavior adjustment that squirrels experience depending on their environment. This article certainly leads to further questions like our research question about when this behavior is learned and what factors into this adaptation.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur research question builds on the research conducted in this article because it questions if this adaptation and tolerance of a human presence is different for older and younger squirrels. Using The Squirrel Census, we can compare the behaviors toward humans for juvenile and adult squirrels."

Also, they discovered that regions with larger Asian populations—among them, New York—had a greater likelihood of experiencing these hate crimes. Racist rhetoric relating to the epidemic has also been linked to hate crimes. Especially, after March 16, 2020, when the accusatory terms “Kung flu” and “Chinese virus” were made public, hate crimes against Asian Americans briefly increased. It is also interesting to note that generally speaking hate crimes have decreased within the US, but with the pandemic anti-Asian hate crimes have actually increased. This article highlights the need for increased attention and action to address anti-Asian racism and hate crimes, specifically in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nOur research question build upon this, by investigating New York specifically.
